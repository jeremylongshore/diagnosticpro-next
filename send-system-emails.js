- Pump repair (if needed): $800-2,500
- **Estimated range: $1,150-3,250** (significantly less than full replacement)`;
  } else if (problemDescription.toLowerCase().includes('transmission')) {

- Diagnostic fee: $150-250
- Transmission service/repair: $400-1,800
- Component replacement: $600-3,500

- Diagnostic fee: $150-300
- Parts: $300-1,500 (depending on specific component)
- Labor: $120-200/hour (2-8 hours typical)

**URGENT RECOMMENDATION**: Get a second opinion before authorizing any work over $1,000. The shop's diagnosis appears to lack sufficient evidence and the quote seems inflated.

**Next Steps**:
1. Request detailed diagnostic report with specific test results
2. Ask to see the actual failed components before replacement
3. Get quotes from 2-3 other certified repair facilities
4. Consider independent diagnostic inspection ($200-400 well spent)
5. Do not authorize work under pressure - legitimate repairs can wait for proper verification

**WARRANTY WARNING**: Ensure any authorized work includes comprehensive warranty coverage and detailed documentation of all repairs performed.
