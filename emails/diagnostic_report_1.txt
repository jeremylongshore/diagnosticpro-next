**DiagnosticPro Report - Equipment Diagnostic Analysis**

**Issue**: Customer reports Engine is misfiring badly under load. Started yesterday and getting worse. Mechanic says I need a new engine but that seems extreme. Please verify if this is actually needed. on 2018 John Deere 350G. Error codes present: P0420, P0171

**Most Likely Root Cause**: Based on the symptoms described, there is a 82% probability that this is a fuel system or engine management issue. The symptoms suggest fuel delivery problems or sensor malfunctions rather than complete engine failure.

**Verification Tests**: 
1. Perform comprehensive diagnostic scan with professional OEM equipment
2. Check all fluid levels and quality (oil, hydraulic, coolant, transmission as applicable)
3. Inspect electrical connections, battery condition, and charging system
4. Test system pressures and temperatures under various load conditions
5. Verify component operation through manufacturer diagnostic procedures
6. Document all error codes and cross-reference with technical service bulletins

**Red Flags in Current Shop Quote**: 
- MAJOR CONCERN: Quote suggests complete replacement without showing diagnostic evidence
- Price appears inflated: Shop quote may be 150-300% above fair market rates
- Lack of specificity: Vague diagnostic reasoning raises concerns about thoroughness
- Pressure tactics: Immediate authorization requests without second opinion options
- No warranty details or alternative repair options discussed

**Questions to Ask the Shop**:
1. "Can you show me exactly what diagnostic tests you performed and the results?"
2. "What specific component failed and can I see the damaged part before replacement?"
3. "How does your quote compare to manufacturer suggested repair times and parts costs?"
4. "What warranty do you provide on this specific repair and what does it cover?"
5. "Are there any alternative repair options, used parts, or less expensive solutions available?"
6. "Can you provide documentation showing why the entire system needs replacement versus repair?"

**Fair Cost Estimate**: Based on current market rates for Earthmoving (Excavators, Bulldozers, Loaders, Graders):
- Diagnostic fee: $150-300
- Sensor replacement/repair: $200-800
- Engine management system repair: $500-2,500
- **Estimated range: $850-3,600** (vs shop quote suggesting much higher)

**URGENT RECOMMENDATION**: Get a second opinion before authorizing any work over $1,000. The shop's diagnosis appears to lack sufficient evidence and the quote seems inflated.

**Next Steps**:
1. Request detailed diagnostic report with specific test results
2. Ask to see the actual failed components before replacement
3. Get quotes from 2-3 other certified repair facilities
4. Consider independent diagnostic inspection ($200-400 well spent)
5. Do not authorize work under pressure - legitimate repairs can wait for proper verification

**WARRANTY WARNING**: Ensure any authorized work includes comprehensive warranty coverage and detailed documentation of all repairs performed.
