            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is DiagnosticPro's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our website, diagnosticpro.io, and other sites we own and operate.</p>

            <p>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use a website or online service.</p>

            <p>In the event our site contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies.
