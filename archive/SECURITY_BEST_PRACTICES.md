## 1. General Security Principles

### 1.1 Core Security Mindset

**Security First Approach:**
- Security considerations in all decisions
- "What could go wrong?" mentality
- Proactive risk identification
- Defense-in-depth strategy
- Continuous security awareness

**Key Principles:**
- **Least Privilege:** Minimum necessary access only
- **Zero Trust:** Verify everything, trust nothing
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security
- **Fail Secure:** System failures should default to secure state
- **Security by Design:** Build security into everything

### 1.2 Individual Responsibility

**Every Team Member Must:**
- Protect company and customer data
- Report security concerns immediately
- Follow established security procedures
- Maintain security awareness
- Participate in security training

**Personal Accountability:**
- You are responsible for your actions
- Security violations have consequences
- When in doubt, ask security team
- Err on the side of caution
- Document security decisions

## 2. Access Management Best Practices

### 2.1 Account Security

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 12 characters length
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No dictionary words or personal information
- Unique passwords for each account
- Change immediately if compromised

**Password Management:**
- Use approved password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
- Enable password manager security features
- Never share passwords
- Use generated passwords when possible
- Regular password audits and updates

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
```
Required for ALL accounts:
✓ Email accounts (Gmail, business email)
✓ Cloud platforms (Google Cloud, AWS)
✓ Code repositories (GitHub, GitLab)
✓ Financial accounts (Stripe, banking)
✓ Administrative tools and dashboards
```

**MFA Best Practices:**
- Use authenticator app over SMS when possible
- Backup codes stored securely offline
- Multiple devices configured where supported
- Hardware tokens for highest-privilege accounts

### 2.2 Account Lifecycle Management

**New Employee Setup:**
1. Create accounts with minimum necessary permissions
2. Provide security training before system access
3. Configure MFA on all accounts
4. Document account creation and permissions
5. Review access after 30 days

**Permission Reviews:**
- Quarterly access reviews for all team members
- Remove unused accounts and permissions
- Validate business need for each access
- Document review results
- Escalate suspicious access patterns

**Employee Departure:**
1. Disable all accounts immediately
2. Revoke API keys and access tokens
3. Remove from shared services and tools
4. Collect company devices and credentials
5. Document offboarding completion

### 2.3 Privileged Access Management

**Administrative Access:**
- Separate admin accounts from regular accounts
- Time-limited elevated access when possible
- Log all administrative actions
- Require additional approval for high-risk operations
- Regular review of privileged users

**Service Accounts:**
- Minimal permissions for automated processes
- Regular rotation of service account credentials
- Monitor service account usage patterns
- Document purpose and owner for each account
- Disable unused service accounts

## 3. Development Security Practices

### 3.1 Secure Coding Standards

**Input Validation:**
```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Validate and sanitize all inputs
function validateEmail(email) {
    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid email format');
    }
    return email.toLowerCase().trim();
}

// ❌ BAD: Direct use of user input
function badExample(userInput) {
    database.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${userInput}'`);
}
```

**Data Protection:**
```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Encrypt sensitive data
const encryptedData = encrypt(sensitiveData, encryptionKey);

// ✅ GOOD: Use parameterized queries
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?';
database.query(query, [userEmail]);

// ❌ BAD: Store sensitive data in plain text
const password = req.body.password; // Store hashed instead
```

**Error Handling:**
```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Generic error messages to users
try {
    authenticateUser(credentials);
} catch (error) {
    logger.error('Authentication failed', { error, userIP });
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication failed' });
}

// ❌ BAD: Exposing internal details
catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message }); // Reveals internal info
}
```

### 3.2 Code Review Security Checklist

**Pre-Commit Checklist:**

**Third-Party Libraries:**
```json
// package.json security practices
{
  "scripts": {
    "audit": "npm audit",
    "audit-fix": "npm audit fix"
  }
}
```

**Dependency Security:**
- Run security audits before each deployment
- Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- Review security advisories for used libraries
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use package-lock.json for reproducible builds

**Vulnerability Management:**
1. **Daily:** Automated dependency scanning
