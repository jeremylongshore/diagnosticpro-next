- Lower percentages suggest multiple possible causes

- **üü° Medium:** Should be addressed within a week  
- **üü† High:** Needs attention within 1-2 days

1. Use the "Questions for Your Mechanic" section
2. Get quotes from repair shops
3. Verify quotes match our cost estimates
4. Proceed with recommended repairs

**If Diagnosis is Medium Confidence (60-79%):**
1. Have a mechanic perform the diagnostic tests we suggest

3. Consider additional testing if needed

**If Diagnosis is Lower Confidence (<60%):**
1. Multiple causes are possible
2. Professional hands-on diagnosis recommended
3. Use our report as a starting point for investigation

### 8.3 Talking to Mechanics
**Use these phrases:**
- "I have a diagnostic report that suggests..."

- "The report recommends testing..."
- "Are these cost estimates reasonable for this type of repair?"

**Questions to Ask:**
