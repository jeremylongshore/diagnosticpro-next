## ***What Customers Will Experience \- Explained for Non-Tech People***

---

## **What Your App Does (The Simple Version)**

Imagine you have a broken car, boat, or piece of equipment and you don't know what's wrong. Instead of getting ripped off by repair shops that just throw expensive parts at the problem hoping something works, your app finds the real root cause \- like having a master detective mechanic in your pocket.

**The Problem You're Solving:**

* People get overcharged for unnecessary repairs  
* Shops often guess instead of properly diagnosing (called "parts throwing")  
* Customers have no way to verify if shops are being honest  
* Expert knowledge is expensive and hard to access  
* **Most importantly:** Shops replace expensive parts one by one instead of finding the actual problem

**Your Solution:** An app that gives anyone instant access to expert-level diagnostic knowledge, stops "parts throwing" waste, and connects them with real experts when needed.

**What is "Parts Throwing"?** Instead of properly diagnosing the root cause, many shops will:

* Replace the most expensive part first  
* When that doesn't work, try the next expensive part  
* Keep replacing parts until something fixes it  
* Charge you for every wrong guess

**Example:** Your car has rough idle. Bad shop replaces spark plugs ($200), then ignition coils ($400), then fuel injectors ($800), then finally finds it was a $30 vacuum hose. You paid $1,430 for a $30 problem.

## **How Customers Will Use Your App**

### **Step 1: Customer Has a Problem**

**Example:** Sarah's truck won't start, and she's worried about expensive repair bills.

### **Step 2: Customer Opens Your App**

### **Step 3: Customer Describes Their Problem**

**What they do:**

* Enter any error codes or warning lights  
* Choose service level: Basic diagnosis ($40) or Premium with shop verification ($60)

**Customer sees:** "Analyzing your problem... this usually takes 2-3 minutes"

### **Step 5: Customer Gets Instant Results**

**What they receive in email:**

* **Root Cause Diagnosis:** "Real problem: Loose battery cable connection, not a dead battery"  
* **Invoice Analysis (if uploaded):** "Shop is charging $350 for battery replacement \+ $200 labor. This is 300% overpriced for a 5-minute cable tightening."  
* **Why shops get it wrong:** "Many shops would replace the battery ($150), then the starter ($400), then finally find the loose cable"  
* **The actual fix:** "Tighten battery cable connection \- 5 minutes, free"  
* **Ripoff Protection:** "Shop invoice shows classic 'parts throwing' pattern \- they're guessing with your money"  
* **What to tell the shop:** "Ask them to check battery cable connections first before replacing anything"

* **App's analysis:** "Invoice shows classic ripoff pattern \- no diagnostic testing itemized"  
* **App reveals:** "Symptoms you described indicate $180 solenoid problem, not full transmission"  
* **Ripoff detection:** "Shop wants $3,000 for problem they haven't properly diagnosed"  
* **App's protection questions:** "Ask shop: 'What specific tests confirmed transmission failure? Can you show me the pressure test results?'"  
* **Shop's response:** "Well, we assumed transmission was bad based on codes..."  
* **App's verdict:** "RIPOFF CONFIRMED \- shop is guessing with $3,000 of your money"
